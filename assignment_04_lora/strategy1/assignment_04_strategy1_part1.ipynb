    "# Strategy 1: Using RAG Chain from Assignment 3\n",
    "## From Assignment 3, we discovered that a RAG chain built using the following combination yielded the best results:\n",
    "- Changing the chunk size to 512 with a chunk overlap of 100.\n",
    "- Adding more data sources.\n",
    "- Incorporating a prompt template to guide the LLM.\n",
    "## Hence, we will be using the same RAG chain to generate training data, and expect this RAG chain to provide better answers compared to the RAG chain used in the baseline strategy of assignment 4."
